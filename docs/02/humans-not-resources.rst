2 - "Humans, Not Resources"
===========================

In most businesses of any type, the people who make up the business should be
the biggest consideration. They make the processes work, they solve the
problems & innovate, they (usually) are what cost the most.

Therefore, it makes the most sense to focus on the people next, specifically
your Engineering department. Let's deal with common misconceptions first:

**"Humans, Not Resources"**
   As the title says, they are capital-H *Humans*, not *Resources*. A resource
   is a uniform raw material (e.g. wood, metal, glass). Within their category,
   they're largely completely interchangable. And you *expect* to **consume**
   them in the process of making something else.

   But that's not true of the human beings that work for you. True, some of
   their skills have (significant) overlaps. But their experience, their
   thoughts, their approaches, & their situations (at work & outside) are all
   very different. So you should not treat them as interchangable resources, but
   as the people they are.

   And if you *expect* to **consume** people, you're designing for burnout,
   resentment, & turnover. Stop wasting your time, & stop reading here.

**Work Should Be Their First & Only Priority.**
   Sorry to be the one to break it to you, but these are human beings. They
   have rich & diverse lives outside of work. Many have families, and/or a
   network of friends.

   Even in the blackest/bleakest of work conditions, they spend at most half
   their time at work. They may work for the company for a handful of years. In
   the context of their life, you & your company are a blip (or a bump) on the
   timeline.

   If you want to be remembered well & want your workplace to be great, you
   must support a healthy work/life balance. Extra hours, emergencies, unplanned
   trips, etc. will all happen, but they're easier to accept (& put in your
   best) in they're not the norm.

**They Owe Their Loyalty To The Company.**
   At past times in history, this was the case. When there were society-changing
   events (e.g. Industrial Revolution in the West), when there were no other
   options (e.g. large-scale depressions), when companies took care of their
   employees *beyond retirement*.

   We don't, and haven't, lived in this world for a long time now. And unless
   your company somehow either literally owns their body, or somehow saved them
   from death, the people you employ **DON'T** owe you their loyalty.

   In the modern era, you're employed At-Will. Companies will terminate you, at
   any time, for any reason (& sometimes no reason). What's often overlooked is
   that this is a two-way street.

   If you want their loyalty, you need to earn it. And you need to expect it
   in moderation, because there is almost always someone in their life (e.g.
   spouse, partner, children, parents, etc.) who has or deserves more of their
   loyalty.

Early on in my career, a friend once told me: *"When you're on your death bed,
it won't be the company by your bedside, it'll be your family & friends.
You won't be wishing you spent more time at work; you'll be wishing you spent
more time with these people."*

You work with Adults, so treat them like Adults.

So, with the misconceptions out of the way, what're some positive things you
should be doing?

Results, Not Hours
------------------

This one can be devisive, but hear me out:

.. important::
   As a rule of thumb, I couldn't care less *what hours* my people work; I care
   about *the results* they produce.

Especially in Engineering, the vast majority of the effort in
producing/maintaining a product of service is **non-mechanical** and
**non-linear**.

It's the work of the mind, and minds aren't machines. Minds aren't reliably
productive all the time, they work in fits & spurts, and they are not solely
dedicated to one task/one situation.

We've all had times where we're In The Zoneâ„¢, periods of intense productivity.
We had a flash of insight, finding a solution that's novel, or will save an
immense amount of time/effort. Or we're feeling inspired and motivated,
effortlessly churning through work in a fraction of the normal time it would
take.

Conversely, we've all had times where we're sluggish post-lunch. Or we aren't
sleeping well, & are struggling to get started. And that's not even including
the curveballs life throws at us: our child needs to go to the doctor, a death
occurs in the family, a friend needs a pickup at the airport.

And, perhaps surprisingly, in my two decades of experience in the industry,
the company *almost always* comes out **ahead** regardless. If you have
motivated, happy, fulfilled employees who like their jobs & like what they work
on? They're personally invested, & they make damn sure the job gets done and
done well.

The **results** of the employee's efforts are what sell the product, not their
time card.

In practice, this looks like:

#. Communicate the expectation of results, not hours.
#. If necessary, setup a subset of the day as "core" hours, where everyone has
   overlapping time (to facilitate setting up meetings, pairing, etc.). Keep
   this window as small as reasonable/possible.
#. Communicate the expectation that people let their manager and/or team know
   ahead of time if they'll be unable to work some portion of "core" hours.
#. Ask people to setup their (shared) calendars to reflect the hours they
   normally expect to work, & to keep their calendars up-to-date.
#. Then just focus on measuring results, not timesheets.

.. note::
   Of course, there are exceptions to this. Some may try to abuse the
   flexibility, or there may be extenuating circumstances, or if your company
   has contractual obligations to external parties for dedicated times.

   Generally, if it's interrupting others, or if it's affecting results, it's
   time to talk with the employee & try to work through things first. There may
   be something in play that you're unaware of, or that they can't control.

   Be clear in communications, in recording of meeting with the employee, in
   the affect on results/others, and use good judgement on when more is needed.
