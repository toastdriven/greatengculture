Prologue - The Five "W"s
========================

Let's quickly get some quick front matter out of the way, starting with the
three less-important questions (*who*, *when*, *where*), before we tackle the
juicy bits (*what*, & *why*).

If you don't care about who wrote this, already trust, and/or just want to get
to the good stuff, see :doc:`/01/a-seat-at-the-table`.

Who Wrote This?
---------------

Hi. I'm `Daniel Lindsley <https://toastdriven.com/>`_.

* I tend to go by either ``@toastdriven`` or ``@daniellindsley`` most
  everywhere.
* Professional software developer since 2005.
* I've held titles like *"Founder"*, *"Principal Engineer"*,
  *"Staff Software Engineer"*, *"Senior Software Engineer"*, etc. (but don't
  put too much faith in titles...)
* Long-time OSS contributor to a bunch of projects.
* Speaker at `PyCon <https://us.pycon.org/>`_,
  `DjangoCon <https://djangocon.us>`_, and elsewhere in the past.

Why Did You Write This?
-----------------------

When most businesses are started, there's **rarely** anything to follow. Beyond
a few legal requirements and/or bits of documentation, there's precious little
required. Much of the business' organization, & day-to-day, springs out of
*past experiences* or *habits*.

Especially in the case of start-ups, faced with a short runway and a *do-or-die*
scenario, all the focus tends to be spent on getting the product/service out
the door, & into customer's hands.

This leads to organic growth, and *sometimes* good things can bloom from the
result...

**...But...**

Frequently, that result is:

* Highly-specific to the organization
* Created from pain points experienced along the way
* Unevenly distributed amongst teams, team members, etc.
* Ungainly structures that **Work Now™** fall apart as scale increases
* ...And you have to start all over again at the next job

**So, with that in mind...**

What *Is* This?
---------------

This is **my** open guide on how to build the best damn **Engineering**
department that you can.

We'll cover:

* How to standardize, ...
* What to consider, ...
* How to build for growth, ...
* & how to create a non-hostile, fair, fun, productive workplace that you and
  others can love working at.

What *Isn't* This?
------------------

**A Perfect Solution**
   There's no formula for the perfect workplace. I'm doing my best to adapt the
   cream of my many experiences, but not everything will work for everyone.

**A Complete Solution**
   You'll have to work out some things for yourself. There may be blind spots,
   or things highly-custom to your environment you'll have to separately solve.

**An Enterprise Grade™ Solution**
   I don't know the upper limits on the scalability of this (*largest I've
   personally seen most of this work in was a ~250 person department*). I don't
   have answers for if you have next-to-no control, or a heavily pre-defined
   department/organization. And I also don't know how well it'll work in
   otherwise highly-political, BS-heavy environments. ``YMMV.``

Still With Me?

your company. If so, I'd love to hear about it, so please
